<h3><a name="biography">Short Biography</a></h3>Welcome! I am a PhD graduated from <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:#02197F">University of Minnesota - Twin Cities</a>, advised by Professor <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~zhzhang/" target="_blank" style="color:#02197F">Zhi-Li Zhang</a>. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in software engineering and computer science from <a href="http://www.seu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" style="color:#02197F">Southeast University</a> in 2011 and 2013 respectively. 
I started my first full-time job in streaming team (samza, kafka, and brooklyn) at  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-zhang-75432184/" target="_blank" style="color:      #02197F">LinkedIn</a>! 
My research interests are <b>Computer Networks and Distributed Systems</b>.
<!--, and <b>multipath transport</b>-->
<!--I have been doing researches in some of these fields since I was a junior student in college. -->
<!-- I have published several papers in journals and international conferences such as SOSR, INFOCOM, CCS Workshp on Security and Privacy in Smartphones and Mobile Devices and IET Conference Wireless Sensor Network. I have filed a patent application based on the results obtained from one of my research projects. In addition, I participated in several National Innovation Competitions in my bachelor years. For example, I was awarded the first prize in the National Innovation Software Designing Competition. Another piece of my work was awarded the second prize. I was ranked among the top 8 in the Microsoft Software Designing Competition. In Microsoft technology training program, I was regarded as the Excellent Project Manager. Moreover, during my 3-month internships at Microsoft, Narus, Bell Labs, AT&T Labs, Cisco, HP Labs, and Twitter, my diligence and initiative are appreciated by my mentors. In my spare time, I enjoy crayon painting. It is a pleasure to show my paintings to my friends, and I was told that they like my paintings a lot. -->
I published 12 papers in these fields, and very luckily one of my papers was awarded as best paper. In addition, I received software designing competition awards and published system-oriented papers in my bachelor years. Moreover, I interned in both research labs and enterprises, and filed 5 patents during internships. The internship experiences help me a lot in understanding what kind of working environment fits me most. During internships at different research labs and companies, my diligence and initiative were appreciated by my mentors and managers. In my spare time, I enjoy crayon painting. It is a pleasure to show my paintings to my friends, and I was told that they like my paintings a lot.
